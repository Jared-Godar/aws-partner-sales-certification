# AWS Cloud Economics

## Module 2: Cost Savings

- How much money do customers pay for traditional IT vs AWS?
- Reduce costs and increase productivity

### Cost Savings Analysis

- Help customer compare costs and build business case for migration to AWS
- Total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis
  - Migration to AWS
  - Ongoing costs
- Understand true scope of current costs
  - Hardware
  - Software
  - Labor
  - Data center
  - Network
  - Other
- Internal analysis often incomplete
- Fewer cores needed on AWS
  - Peak
  - Research
  - 20-40% fewer cores than on-premises

### Lower costs with AWS

- Consumption-based pricing
  - Pay for what you use
  - No upfront costs
  - No long-term commitments
  - No minimum fees
- AWS Pricing Models
  - On-demand
  - Reserved
  - Spot
  - Dedicated Hosts
- Price Reductions
  - Savings Plans
  - Massive scale
  - Improve efficiencies
  - Reduce costs
  - Automatically apply to all customers
    - S3 Glacier down 30% across the board
    - EBS Snapshots down 47%

### AWS Flywheel

- Lower infrastructure costs
- Reduced prices
- More customers
- More usage
- More infrastructure
- Economies of scale
- Low prices and continuous reductions

### Provisioning Infrastructure

- Deal with spikes in demand
- Don't get caught underprovisioned and unable to deliver

### Migration Costs

- Sunk infrastructure costs
  - Hardware not fully depreciated
- Migration costs

(Cost Savings)/(Sunk Infrastructure Costs + Migration Costs) = ROI

### Sunk Costs

- Easy to calculate
- Non-depreciated hardware assets
- Can any value be recovered?
  - Sell to third party
  - Sell to AWS
  - Sell to other customers
- When was the data center built?
- How much longer will you use it when transition to AWS
- Depreciation schedule
- Data Center Recovery Value
  - Give it away and let someone else pay for maintenance
  - 10% of cost? 55% of DV?
  - Sunk 40M to 18M - less than half of original estimate

  - Have one person do entire analysis
    - Too complex for one person to comprehensively perform analysis
  - Don't wait
    - Comprehensive analysis can take weeks or months
  - Don't perform cost analysis unless customer asks for it
- Works
  - 3 or 5 year depreciation
  - 3 year RI
  - Volume RI discounts
  - Realistic ratios
  - Cost benefits of automation
    - Autoscaling
    - APIs
    - AWS Trusted Advisor

    - Timeline, scope, and roles
  - Roles
    - Who is responsible for what
    - Gathering data
    - Assumptions vs actual
  - Data Collection (2-4 weeks)
    - Most time consuming part of process
    - Who is accountable for what portion
  - Initial assessment
    - Review data
